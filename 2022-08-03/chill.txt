; use waituntil if you are starting the plan early in the day. Chilling should start
; about 40 minutes before sunset for dusk flats, or 40 minutes before the first images you want to take.

; the time is in UTC – so it is about 8:00PM CDT
#waituntil 1, 1:10:00

; Chill in stages so that the chilling doesn’t time out
